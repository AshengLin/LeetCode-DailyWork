# Given the head of a singly linked list, reverse the list, and return the rever
# sed list. 
# 
#  
#  Example 1: 
# 
#  
# Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
# Output: [5,4,3,2,1]
#  
# 
#  Example 2: 
# 
#  
# Input: head = [1,2]
# Output: [2,1]
#  
# 
#  Example 3: 
# 
#  
# Input: head = []
# Output: []
#  
# 
#  
#  Constraints: 
# 
#  
#  The number of nodes in the list is the range [0, 5000]. 
#  -5000 <= Node.val <= 5000 
#  
# 
#  
#  Follow up: A linked list can be reversed either iteratively or recursively. C
# ould you implement both?
